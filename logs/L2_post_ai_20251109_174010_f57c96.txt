Thank you for sharing your journey with us. Given your focus on attacking play, particularly your impressive aerial skills rated at 9, we’ve selected three sticks that will enhance your performance on the pitch. Each option is designed to support your ambitions, allowing you to execute advanced techniques with confidence and precision.

The three sticks we recommend are all from the Mercian Genesis CF25 range, featuring a 25% carbon composition that provides the necessary stiffness for powerful hits while ensuring a high level of touch and control. All three sticks share a Pro Bend, which is positioned 230mm from the bottom, giving you excellent turnover and hitting power. However, they differ slightly in their availability and specific features. Each stick has a drag flicking rating of 4.0 and an aerial rating of 4.0, indicating their capability to support your aerial skills. The construction includes a fibreglass micro-skeleton that enhances energy absorption, contributing to a more responsive feel during play. 

Rest assured, regardless of the stick you choose, you will experience enhanced control and performance, empowering you to take on the pitch with confidence and achieve your goals.
