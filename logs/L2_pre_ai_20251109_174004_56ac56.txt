PLAYER_PROFILE — describes the customer’s style, skill level, bow preference, and budget.  \n2. STICKS — factual data for the three recommended sticks taken verbatim from Excel (Product Facts Capsule).  \n3. BOW DEFINITIONS — factual explanations of each bow type.  \n4. BRIEF (this file) — defines how to interpret and use those inputs.\n\nTASK\nWrite a professional, client-facing explanation in Mercian’s confident, UK-English tone that:\n• Connects the PLAYER_PROFILE to the selection (“Because you said…”).  \n• Compares the three sticks using only factual differences in the STICKS capsule.  \n• Uses BOW DEFINITIONS to explain the performance implications of each bow type.  \n• Ends with one clear reassurance sentence about control, confidence, and performance.\n\nSTRUCTURE\nParagraph 1 – Link the customer’s goals (from PLAYER_PROFILE) to the overall selection.  \nParagraph 2 – Compare the three sticks factually, showing what’s common and what differs (Carbon %, Power vs Touch, Bow type, etc.).  \nParagraph 3 – Reassurance line that reinforces confidence and alignment with the player’s journey.\n\nVOICE & TONE\nSpeak as a teammate who understands the player’s journey and shares their ambition.  \nConfidence without arrogance; knowledge without jargon.  \nReplace generic phrases (e.g. “enhances performance”) with grounded insight (e.g. “lets you lift earlier and recover faster in tight spaces”).  \nSound human, encouraging and assured — never salesy. Align to brand.\n\nINTERPRETATION RULE\nWhen linking Product Facts to PLAYER_PROFILE, always explain *why* a feature matters to that player’s goals.  \nExample: “Because your aerials rating is 9, the lower bow lets you lift with less effort.”  \nIf data is missing for a feature, omit it rather than guess.\n\nENDING STYLE\nFinish with a single, uplifting sentence that leaves the player feeling ready to step onto the pitch and win before they play.\n\nCOMPLIANCE NOTES\n- Use only data present in STICKS and BOW DEFINITIONS.  \n- Do not claim that all sticks share a feature unless every one lists it explicitly.  \n- Do not invent or infer any features, specs, or marketing claims.  \n- If a data field is missing, omit that comparison.  \n- Prefer clear, grounded phrasing over marketing language.  \n- Keep tone warm, confident, and conversational, as if from a trusted coach.\n\nRULES\n1. Output plain text (no bullets or lists).  \n2. Use complete, well-punctuated sentences in UK English.  \n3. Mention bow shape only if BOW DEFINITIONS provides relevant data.  \n4. Reference carbon %, construction, or lay-up only when present in STICKS.  \n5. If two sticks are similar, describe what the player is truly choosing between.  \n6. Never restate data verbatim; interpret differences naturally.  \n7. Produce clean, multi-paragraph prose ready for direct display on a website.\n\n\nCONTEXT:\nPLAYER_PROFILE: journey=Genesis, focus=attack:8.0, aerials:9.0, dragflick:3.0, budget=£400.0.\n\nSTICKS:\nProduct Facts Capsule — Source: StickSelection.xlsx (verbatim descriptions)\n#1 Mercian Genesis CF25 Hockey Stick - Intermediate Composite Stick (36.5)\nProduct Code HSGECF2525PUR36 · Title Mercian Genesis CF25 Hockey Stick - Intermediate Composite Stick · Player Type Outdoor Player · Playing Level Genesis · Carbon 25.0 · Bow Pro · Length 36.5 · RRP 110.0 · Available 37 · Updated 2025-10-06T12:23:17+01:00 · Drag Flicking 4.0 · Aerial 4.0 · Reverse Stick Hitting 4.5 · Power 6.5 · Touch and Control 9.5 · 3D 7.0 · Hitting & Passing 10.0 · Playing Level Genesis\nDescription (verbatim): Product Overview:\nGenesis CF25 Hockey Stick - Intermediate Composite Stick\nThe Genesis CF25 is an intermediate carbon composite stick designed for junior players who want to deliver more power with their hit and slap skills. The 25% carbon delivers the required stiffness, while the fibreglass provides touch, feel, and durability. The lightweight construction and higher balance point make skill execution easier for juniors, while the full-size head enhances hitting and slapping power. Nano polymer resin creates a flexible but stronger bond between composite layers, increasing stiffness and reducing the risk of de-lamination.\nKey Features:\n\n\nHigh-Quality Carbon: Preferred carbon from Japan, Germany, Scotland, and South Africa provides stiffness but can be brittle. Combining carbon with fibreglass and Kevlar enhances strength and durability.\n\nFibreglass Construction: Fine glass fibres combined into thicker fibres, dipped in resin, and laid out to create single directional sheets. These sheets are layered at different angles for multi-directional strength.\n\nHigh Friction Finish: The final layer of lacquer on the face of the stick is mixed with fine grains of silicon polymer to create a texture that stops the ball spinning on contact. These tiny rubber particles 'squash' on ball impact, providing a damping effect.\n\nPro (Low) Bend: 23.5mm bend at 230mm from the head.\n\nM-Gel Vibration Control: Silicon gel injected into the handle absorbs vibrations caused by power skills such as hitting and slapping, providing much more feel.\n\nFibreglass Micro-Skeleton and Laminates: Forms a flexible base that absorbs energy, combined with carbon, Kevlar, and basalt for enhanced performance.\n\n#2 Mercian Genesis CF25 Hockey Stick - Intermediate Composite Stick (36.5)\nProduct Code HSGECF2525MAR36 · Title Mercian Genesis CF25 Hockey Stick - Intermediate Composite Stick · Player Type Outdoor Player · Playing Level Genesis · Carbon 25.0 · Bow Pro · Length 36.5 · RRP 110.0 · Available 18 · Updated 2025-10-06T12:23:16+01:00 · Drag Flicking 4.0 · Aerial 4.0 · Reverse Stick Hitting 4.5 · Power 6.5 · Touch and Control 9.5 · 3D 7.0 · Hitting & Passing 10.0 · Playing Level Genesis\nDescription (verbatim): Product Overview:\nGenesis CF25 Hockey Stick - Intermediate Composite Stick\nThe Genesis CF25 is an intermediate carbon composite stick designed for junior players who want to deliver more power with their hit and slap skills.

The maximum bend at this lowest legal point enhances drag ﬂicking and aerial skills with the balance point of the stick adjusted to also favour 3D dribbling skills” – it also now has a thinner toe, this aids getting the toe of the stick under the ball on the reverse side to aid 3D skills. In addition to this it also has a sculpted head, shaping the rear surface of the head from a curve to a flat, angled plane removes some of the bulk and assists getting the head of the stick under the ball, opening the face and aiding overhead passes and generally lifting the ball.\nXtreme Bend 2025\nThe Mercian Extreme bend features several of the popular concepts seen in our other bends in addition to some new elements. The toe of the stick has been thinned down both on the face and the back of the head to aid getting the ball into the air for 3D skill execution. The backhand zone has been flattened to aid passing and shooting accuracy. The actual bend of the stick (face) is the same as the Ultimate – 24.5mm at a maximum bend point of 200mm from the head. The extreme bend also has a 2mm concave shaft, with the concave situated above, not including, the stick face, so enhancing flicking and ‘sling-shot’ slapping skills but without compromising the ball / face impact. A 4-degree face twist to aid ball handling, dribbling and control on the reverse side. A thinned handle so that with the EVA under grip on the CKF90 the grip dimensions feel ‘normal’. This bend is available on the CKF55 and CKF85 and CF95 (2024/25 models).\nPro Bend 2025\nThe Mercian Pro Bend incorporates a near maximum 23.5mm bow positioned just below the mid-point of the shaft, approximately 230mm from the bottom of the stick. The shaft has then been shaped to give a thinner proﬁle under the right hand and a balance point that favours the head end of the stick. This gives a combination of great stick turn-over due to the shape but enhanced hitting power because of the balance point and sweet spot, the hitting power is also enhanced because the head is 1.5mm thicker than the Ultimate bend.\nUltimate Bend\nThe Mercian Ultimate Bend is the most aggressive low bow that we have ever made, with the bend of the stick effectively cupping the ball. The maximum bend at this lowest legal point enhances drag ﬂicking and aerial skills with the balance point of the stick adjusted to also favour 3D dribbling skills. Whilst the shaft weighting aid sticks head speed it still provides power and balance for the slapping and pushing associated with elite level skill execution.\nDSH Bend 2025\nThe concave face shape ‘cups’ and cushions the ball to help with close control, 3D skill execution and lifted passes but is obviously within the FIH 4mm deviation guidelines. To create the concave face the head is 2mm thicker than the Ultimate bend and therefore also offers a head weighted bias which aids hitting and slapping power. It is important to note that this bend is also a low bow and definitely not a mid bow stick\nMID Bend\nThe Mercian mid-bow has a 22mm bend situated 300mm up the shaft. A majority of players are still looking for a low or extreme low bow stick that helps with drag flicking, aerials or 3D skill execution. However, an increasing number are looking for a straighter stick, this Mid-bend aligns the hands more with the stick face and so it assists accuracy with hitting and slapping. With some people considering that the primary skills for defensive players are distribution using hitting and slapping, this stick is perfectly suited for that purpose.\n"
